# Introduction

The F5 SDK (JS) provides client libraries to access various F5 products and services. It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services.

Benefits:

- Provides hand-written or auto-generated client code to make F5â€™s APIs/services simple and intuitive to use.
- Handles the low-level details of communication with the API or service, including authentication sessions, async task handling, protocol handling, large file uploads, and more.
- Can be installed using familiar package management tools such as npm.

## Ben Work

The high level goal here is to make an HTTP client that supports everything we need to take our tools to the next level.

### http-timer for axios requests

https://github.com/szmarczak/http-timer

The above plugin adds the following timings object to the response of axios
```typescript
export interface Timings {
    start: number;
    socket?: number;
    lookup?: number;
    connect?: number;
    secureConnect?: number;
    upload?: number;
    response?: number;
    end?: number;
    error?: number;
    abort?: number;
    phases: {
        wait?: number;
        dns?: number;
        tcp?: number;
        tls?: number;
        request?: number;
        firstByte?: number;
        download?: number;
        total?: number;
    };
}
```

### new HTTP Response type including the timings
```typescript
export type HttpResponse = {
    data?: unknown;
    headers?: unknown;
    status: number;
    statusText?: string;
    request?: {
        url: string;
        method: string;
        headers: unknown;
        protocol: string;
        timings: Timings;
        // data?: unknown;
    };
};
```

Using these timings we can log and provide stats about what devices (mainly f5) are responding slower than other or a gathered base line

### Upgrades!
- Full request timings:  (DONE)
  - See timing details above
  - tests updated and working
- token timer  (DONE)
  - Read token TTL and utilize for entire lifetime of token
  - refresh automatically as needed
  - probably need to add more error handling, but this is a good start
  - tests updated and working
- Added support for supplying remote authentication provider (DONE)
  - If none is supplied, the default 'local' is set
- IPv6 support (DONE)
  - Tests with basic usage/connectivity
- Added additional response details necessary for upper layer integration, like request details and full response details


### Further plans (mostly in priority...)
- layered functions that do all the work of uploading/downloadin files and capturing ucs/qkviews
- Expand ils rpm installs to monitor restjavad/restnoded processes to complete restart for job completion
  - Currently only seems to make sure the install process completed, not that the services have restarted and are ready for processing again.
  - This needs to be monitored so other processes are not trying to use the service while it's restarting.  Depending on the host f5 config size and resources, this can take anywhere between 20 and 90 seconds.
- bigiq specific support
  - confirm installing/uninstalling of ATC service (fast/as3/do/ts)
    - has different api... :(
  - confirm file upload/download
  - confirm bigiq ucs/qkview generation
  - service discovery
  - can we get the necessary details from the same CDN network?
- Service discovery for ATC (maybe?)
  - What services are installed
- Support both http and https connections (maybe?)
  - When connecting to an F5 device only HTTPS will be used
  - But there may be use cases where http is necessary for some sort of external connection
- May leave open the option for connecting over a linux socket also... (maybe?)
- Possible support for following redirects
  - Should be part of axios client (just need to document how to use it)
- Support for failed auth events (probably not)
  - This is to allow the packege to be consumed by any other service, like a command line tool, but also be able to integrate into the vscode extension to clear password cache when authentication fails
  - Thinking more on this, it should probably be handled by whatever is utilizing the sdk

## Usage

Basic Example:
```javascript
const ManagementClient = require('f5-sdk-js').bigip.ManagementClient;
const AS3Client = require('f5-sdk-js').bigip.extension.AS3Client;

const mgmtClient = new ManagementClient({
    host: '192.0.2.1',
    port: 443,
    user: 'admin',
    password: 'admin'
})
await mgmtClient.login();

const extensionClient = new AS3Client(mgmtClient);
await extensionClient.service.create({ config: {} });
```

Typescript Import Example:
```typescript
import { bigip } from 'f5-sdk-js';

const ManagementClient = bigip.ManagementClient;
const AS3Client = bigip.extension.AS3Client;
```

## Contributor Documentation

A collection of helpful commands have been added to the package manager (npm) scripts directive. Check out the `package.json` for an up-to-date list of commands. 

- Build Package (Typescript -> Javascript): `npm run build-package`
- Build Code Documentation: `npm run build-code-docs`
- Run Unit Tests: `npm run test`
- Run Linter: `npm run lint`

Note that the `main` and `types` package manager directive are pointed at the `dist` folder (where `tsc` builds the package). Please ensure any published packages builds and includes that folder.
